## Layout

Note that there are three subroots in this project:

- workshops - this is a root for all practice tasks, to be processed in group or demo mode
- homework - this is a root for all excercises proposed by course for your own practice at home
- 3rd_party - this is a place where all dependencies are stored. Each dependency has it's *.pri file under rootfolder (e.g. gtest.pri)

## Remarks

Note that gtest is compiled into static library with gtest_main implemented. It means that you do not have to implement _main_ function in your test projects.
