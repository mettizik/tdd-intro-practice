# Homework

Homework is another core part of course activities. These are the tasks you should solve by yourself or with your pair-programming partner (whatever you like more) outside of a group sessions to fixup some practicies in your mind.

All homework tasks are bound to separate workshop sessions and should be solved in order they are provided, wishfully not earlier than the corresponding workshop occurs.

Solved homework tasks should be published into your public repo where mentor can review results you produced. Prefered way is to create your mainline branch and create pull requests from branches corresponding to the task solved.

All available tasks are listed below in corresponding order:

## Basic practicies training:

### Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. (? in the end)

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. (! in the end)

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Implement Bob!

### Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana" the program should return a list containing "inlets".

### Word Wrapp

Write a function, that is given a string and a length limit, splits provided string into sequence of string, where length of each string is not more, than provided limit. If there are spaces under provided limit - last space should be used to wrapp this line. If there are no spaces - wrapp it on provided length limit.

As an acceptance test you can use this input:
```
When pos is specified, the search only includes sequences of characters that begin at or before position pos, ignoring any possible match beginning after pos.
```
It should be wrapped by length of 30 into this sequence of lines (ommiting quotes):
```
"When pos is specified, the",
"search only includes sequences",
"of characters that begin at or",
"before position pos, ignoring",
"any possible match beginning",
"after pos."
```

### Leap Year

Given a year, report if it is a leap year.

The tricky thing here is that a leap year in the Gregorian calendar occurs:

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

For example, 1997 is not a leap year, but 1996 is. 1900 is not a leap year, but 2000 is.

If your language provides a method in the standard library that does this look-up, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

### Trinary

Convert a trinary number, represented as a string (e.g. '102012'), to its decimal equivalent using first principles.

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid trinary as the value 0.

Trinary numbers contain three symbols: 0, 1, and 2.

The last place in a trinary number is the 1's place. The second to last is the 3's place, the third to last is the 9's place, etc.
```
# "102012"
    1       0       2       0       1       2    # the number
1*3^5 + 0*3^4 + 2*3^3 + 0*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0    # the value
  243 +     0 +    54 +     0 +     3 +     2 =  302
```

If your language provides a method in the standard library to perform the conversion, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Functionality decomposition training:

### Bank OCR

Your manager has recently purchased a machine that assists in reading letters and faxes sent in by branch offices. The machine scans the paper documents, and produces a file with a number of entries. You will write a program to parse this file.

#### Specification
#### User Story 1

The following format is created by the machine:
```
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|
```
Each entry is 3 lines long, and each line has 27 characters. 3 lines of each entry contain an account number written using pipes and underscores.

Each account number should have 9 digits, all of which should be in the range 0-9. A normal file contains around 500 entries.

Write a program that can take this file and parse it into actual account numbers.

Example input and output
```
 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
| || || || || || || || || |
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|

=> 000000000

  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

=> 111111111

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
 _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _|
|_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_

=> 222222222

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
 _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _|
 _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _|

=> 333333333

|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

=> 444444444

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
|_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_
 _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _|

=> 555555555

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
|_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_ |_
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|

=> 666666666

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

=> 777777777

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|

=> 888888888

 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|
 _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _| _|

=> 999999999

    _  _     _  _  _  _  _
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|

=> 123456789
```

#### User Story 2

You find the machine sometimes goes wrong while scanning. You will need to validate that the numbers are valid account numbers using a checksum. This can be calculated as follows:
```
account number:  3  4  5  8  8  2  8  6  5
position names:  d9 d8 d7 d6 d5 d4 d3 d2 d1
```
checksum calculation:
```
((1*d1) + (2*d2) + (3*d3) + ... + (9*d9)) mod 11 == 0
```

Example input:

```
Valid:
711111111
123456789
490867715

Invalid:
888888888
490067715
012345678
```

#### User Story 3

Your boss is keen to see your results. He asks you to write out a file of your findings, one for each input file, in this format:
```
457508000
664371495 ERR
86110??36 ILL
```
The output file has one account number per row. If some characters are illegible, they are replaced by a ?. In the case of a wrong checksum, or illegible number, this is noted in a second column indicating status.

Example input and output:
```
    _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
  ||_ | || || || || || || |
  | _||_||_||_||_||_||_||_|

=> 150000000 ERR
 _  _  _  _  _  _  _  _
| || || || || || || ||_   |
|_||_||_||_||_||_||_| _|  |

=> 000000051
    _  _  _  _  _  _     _
|_||_|| || ||_   |  |  | _
  | _||_||_||_|  |  |  | _|

=> 49006771? ILL
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _
  | _| _||_| _ |_   ||_||_|
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _

=> 1234?678? ILL
```

#### User Story 4

It turns out that often when a number comes back as ERR or ILL it is because the scanner has failed to pick up on one pipe or underscore for one of the figures. For example:
```
    _  _  _  _  _  _     _
|_||_|| || ||_   |  |  ||_
  | _||_||_||_|  |  |  | _|
```
The 9 could be an 8 if the scanner had missed one |. Or the 0 could be an 8. Or the 1 could be a 7. The 5 could be a 9 or 6. So your next task is to look at numbers that have come back as ERR or ILL, and try to guess what they should be, by adding or removing just one pipe or underscore.

If there is only one possible number with a valid checksum, then use that. If there are several options, the status should be AMB. If you still can't work out what it should be, the status should be reported ILL.

Example input and output:

```

## Mocking & Faking practicies

### Folder copying

Implement a class for recursively copying files from source directory to the destination directory.

A folder hierarchy and file names must be saved.

Empty folders should not be copied at all.

For example it can be something that looks like a

```
class IFileCopier
{
public:
	virtual void Copy(const std::string& src, const std::string& dst) = 0;
};
```

You don't need to test filesystem functions.
To work with a filesystem you should declare an interface and to mock it.

You can start with GMock from https://goo.gl/j7EkQX, good luck!

## Finalization task:

### Chat-client

Implement chat application, that communicates via TCP sockets.
There is list of requirenments to this application:
* Console application prefered;
* It must use system calls for sockets, such as socket, bind, listen, accept, connect;
* It must create connection between too applications. It must send and receive messages via created connection until it is dropped.

Tips:
* TCP socket can be mocked;
* IO streams can be mocked;
