Implement chat application, that communicates via TCP sockets.
 There is list of requirenments to this application:
 * It receives user nickname through commandline arguments on start
 * It runs only for two clients
 * On start it checks if port 4444 is bound
    * if it is - connects to other client
    * if not - binds a port and waits for inbound connection
        * message "No one is here..." is displayed in UI
 * After establishing connection - handshake is performed:
    * client writes message with it's nickname and ':HELLO!' string to socket ("metizik:HELLO!")
    * server responses with it's nickname and ':HELLO!' magic ("user:HELLO!")
        * if server receives malformated message - it drops connection with this client
        * if client receives malformated message - it drops connection and exits
            * Error message is shown
    * Listening socket must be closed
        (i) More than one client is not allowed to connect

 * It must send messages via created connection, until it is dropped
    * Application outputs "me: " prefix for user input
    * User inputs message through console interface and presses ENTER
    * Text message is sent to socket
 * It must receive messages via created connection, until it is dropped
    * Message received through socket
    * Line with message and '@friend_name: ' prefix is displayed ("metizik: Hello!")
 * END of message is determined by '\0' byte
 * When connection is dropped by one of users
    * "You are alone now" message is displayed to user
    * Application exits

  (i) Client starts dialog
