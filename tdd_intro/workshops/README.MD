# WorkShops

Workshop sessions is one of the core parts of the "Practicing TDD" course. This kind of sessions is implemented in specific way:

Group of people sit in a room with PC and projector. Two men from group peek a task from provided list and implement it in _live_ mode using ping-pong technique. Rest of group observes this process and corrects their actions if they choose a wrong path, or avoiding TDD practicies.

Pairs of programmers switch from task to task.

All workshops sessions tasks are listed below in corresponding order

## FizzBuzz

Nothing but classics. FizzBuzz is a most common kata in the world.

### Task
