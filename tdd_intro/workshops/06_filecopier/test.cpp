/*
Implement a class for recursively copying files from source directory to the destination directory.

A folder hierarchy and file names must be saved.

Empty folders should not be copied at all.

You don't need to test filesystem functions. To work with a filesystem you should declare an interface and to mock it.

You can start with GMock from https://goo.gl/j7EkQX, good luck!
